## The briefing

The stair from the upper vault doesn't lead down so much as *further in*. The lockboxes here hang differently — each one cuffed to the next *and* the previous, two iron rings instead of one. Mavren waits at the entrance with a second coil of chain across her other shoulder.

Last week I taught you a chain that runs *one* way. You walked it from the head. You could not walk it back. And when I asked you to *copy* a chain — you refused, because the only honest answer you had was *delete the request*. This week you give the chain a second ring on every link, and you give yourself the right answer to *copy*. When the vault is asked to hand over its records — and it will be — you will not hand over the *same chain*. You will forge a fresh one, link for link, and let the original stay where it is.
</div>
</div>

Last week your `Chain<T>` was **singly-linked**: each node had `data` and a `next` pointer, plus a `head_` on the chain itself. Walking forward was cheap. Walking *backward* was impossible without rebuilding the whole list, and `push_back` was O(n) because you had to walk to the tail every time. And `Chain(const Chain&)` was `= delete` — you could not copy a chain at all.

This week you fix both. You promote `Chain<T>` to a **doubly-linked list**, and you write the **deep copy** that Floor 4 promised and refused.

You will learn two things, and they tie last week's loose ends together:

1. **The `prev` pointer and the `tail_` handle.** Every node now points both ways. The chain now has a `head_` *and* a `tail_`. You can walk in either direction. `push_back` becomes O(1) — the same constant-time prepend you had on the front, now available on the back. Pop from either end is O(1) too. The price: every operation that touches a link has to keep *both* pointers consistent. Get one wrong and the chain silently breaks in the middle.
2. **Deep copy — closing the Rule of Three.** When `Chain<T> b = a;` runs, `b` must end up with its *own* nodes that hold the same data. Not shared nodes. Not the same `head_`. *Its own chain.* You walk the source from head to tail and `push_back` each value into the destination. When `a` and `b` both go out of scope, each destructor walks and deletes *its own* nodes. Zero shared memory. Zero double-frees.

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/diagrams/doubly-linked-anatomy.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="A row of three nodes. Each node has prev on the left, data in the middle, next on the right. A 'head' arrow points into the leftmost node's prev (which is nullptr). A 'tail' arrow points into the rightmost node's next (which is nullptr). Adjacent nodes are connected by paired arrows: one going right (next) and one going left (prev)."/>
  <figcaption>Doubly-linked: every node has a <code>prev</code> and a <code>next</code>. The chain has a <code>head_</code> <em>and</em> a <code>tail_</code>. The first node's <code>prev</code> is <code>nullptr</code>; the last node's <code>next</code> is <code>nullptr</code>. Two ground symbols, one at each end.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="diagram">
  <img src="{{ '/assets/diagrams/shallow-vs-deep-copy.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Two chain diagrams side by side. Left: shallow copy — two chain handles labelled a and b both have arrows pointing into the same row of three nodes. A red 'double-free' warning glyph hangs over the nodes. Right: deep copy — chain handle a points into one row of three nodes; chain handle b points into a parallel row of three nodes that hold the same values but are physically separate."/>
  <figcaption>Shallow copy (left) is what the compiler-generated copy constructor would give you: two <code>Chain</code> handles, one set of nodes, two destructors fighting over the same memory. Deep copy (right) is what you write: two handles, two physically separate rows of nodes carrying equal values. Each destructor cleans up only what it owns.</figcaption>
</figure>

You are not throwing away last week's `Chain<T>` — you are growing it. The event log still works the same way from `main.cpp`'s perspective (`push_front` for newest-first), but now `log --oldest 5` walks the chain backward from the tail, and `Hero` can be *copied* without the compiler refusing.

## Objectives

By the end of Floor 4½ you will be able to:

- Add a `prev` pointer to `Node<T>` and a `tail_` pointer to `Chain<T>` and explain what invariant ties `head_->prev`, `tail_->next`, and an empty chain together.
- Implement `push_back` in O(1) and explain why it could not have been O(1) without `tail_`.
- Implement `pop_front` and `pop_back` in O(1) — and for `pop_back`, explain why a *singly*-linked list with only a `tail_` pointer still couldn't pop from the back in O(1).
- Walk the chain backward with `for (const Node<T>* p = chain.tail(); p != nullptr; p = p->prev) ...` and state which steps differ from the forward walk.
- Implement `Chain(const Chain& other)` as a deep copy that walks the source and `push_back`s each value into a fresh chain.
- Implement `operator=(const Chain&)` using the **copy-and-swap idiom** — or hand-rolled with `clear()` + copy — and explain why naive assignment (just copying `head_` and `tail_`) is wrong in the same way the compiler-generated version was.
- State the **Rule of Three** in full, and tick all three boxes on your own `Chain<T>`.

## Pre-class

### Reading (ZyBook Ch. 6, continued)

**The whole of Chapter 6 was assigned back on Floor 4.** If any of it is still unread — especially the doubly-linked and iterator sections we hadn't reached in class yet — catch up now. The pointers below are what *this week's* class leans on.

Before **Monday**: §6.6 *Doubly-linked lists* — each node now carries a `prev` as well as a `next`, and the list keeps both a head and a tail.
Before **Wednesday**: §6.7 *Doubly-linked lists: Insert* and §6.8 *Doubly-linked lists: Remove* — the four-pointer surgery (two writes on each side) that two-way links demand.
Before **Friday**: §6.9 *Linked list traversal* (forward *and* reverse — the reverse walk is exactly what `prev` buys you) and §6.12 *Linked lists: Recursion*. The full Rule of Three (destructor, copy, move) your `Chain<T>` needs is class material; the textbook doesn't section it.

The §6.6 animation is the picture you want in your head when you write `push_back`. Watch what changes about `tail_` and what changes about the previous tail's `next`. There are two writes, not one.

There are no pre-class videos. Class time is for live coding and discussion together — your reading is the prep.

## In-class (MWF)

| Day | Focus | Activity |
|-----|-------|----------|
| **M** | `prev`, `tail_`, two-way walk | Live-code the upgrade from `Node { T; Node* next; }` to `Node { T; Node* prev; Node* next; }`. Add `tail_` to `Chain`. Rewrite `push_front` to also wire `prev`, and write `push_back`. Walk the chain backward on the projector. Add a `log --oldest <n>` flavor of the existing command. |
| **W** | Deep copy ctor          | Live-code `Chain(const Chain& other)`. Plant the bug — start with the shallow copy the compiler would have written — and watch the sanitizer / Node counter catch the double-free. Then write the real one. Discussion: why is the source `const`-correct walk easier with `head_` than with `tail_`? |
| **F** | `operator=` + Rule of Three recap | Live-code copy assignment using `clear()` + copy loop. Compare with copy-and-swap as a one-liner. Show the program copying a `Chain<int>` of 1,000 elements with allocations and deallocations both at 1,000. Read the Rule of Three off the whiteboard one last time before we leave this material for iterators. |

## The project — Floor 4½

This week's project increment is **a chain you can walk in both directions and a `Hero` you can copy**.

You will receive (in your starter drop):

- Everything through Floor 4, fully working — `Bag<T>`, `Chain<T>` (singly-linked, with deleted copy ops), the event log, the boss battle, `selftest chain`.
- An upgraded `hero/Chain.h` whose `Node` now has a `prev` pointer and whose `Chain` has a `tail_` member. The single-pointer Floor 4 methods are still there but several have **stubs that don't yet wire `prev`** — that's intentional; you'll fix them.
- Signatures for `push_back`, `pop_front`, `pop_back`, `tail()`, and the new copy ctor and copy assignment. Each is a TODO.
- A `main.cpp` with two new commands: `log --oldest <n>` (walks from `tail()` backward, calling your new accessor) and `clone hero` (constructs a `Hero` copy in a local scope and prints both event logs side-by-side before the copy is destroyed).
- An expanded `selftest chain` harness that copies a 1,000-element chain, lets the copy die, and asserts that the original is still walkable in both directions and the allocation/deallocation counts balance.

You will write:

1. **Monday:** Add `prev` to `Node`; add `tail_` to `Chain`. Rewire `push_front` to set `prev`. Implement `push_back`, `tail()`, and the backward walk used by `log --oldest`. Update the destructor — it still walks via `next`, but now you delete a node whose `prev` you no longer need (a useful one-line consistency check: assert `tail_->next == nullptr` in debug builds).
2. **Wednesday:** Implement `Chain(const Chain& other)` as a deep copy. Start by deliberately writing the shallow version (`head_ = other.head_; tail_ = other.tail_; size_ = other.size_;`) and running `selftest chain` — read the sanitizer/counter output, *then* delete it and write the deep copy.
3. **Friday:** Implement `operator=(const Chain& other)`. Either use copy-and-swap (`Chain tmp(other); swap(*this, tmp);`) or the explicit form (`clear(); for each node in other, push_back(node->data);`). Whichever you choose, defend it in your lab notes. Implement `pop_front` and `pop_back`. Run `selftest chain` one last time and confirm a clean balance.

### Lab 4½ — *Both Directions, Twice the Iron* (folded into the project)

There is no separate lab handout. The work you do this week *is* the lab.

Commit `floor-04h/lab-notes.md` to your project repo with:

1. A transcript of the demo above.
2. **Break a `prev` pointer on purpose.** In `push_back`, omit the line that sets `new_node->prev = tail_;`. Run `log --oldest 5`. Describe exactly what gets printed — and explain in one sentence which step of the backward walk reads the bad pointer. Restore the line.
3. **Try the shallow copy.** Replace your `Chain(const Chain&)` body with a literal field-by-field copy: `head_ = other.head_; tail_ = other.tail_; size_ = other.size_;`. Run `selftest chain`. Paste the failure. Which exact line of which destructor was the second `delete` on the same node? Restore the deep copy.
4. **Compare copy-and-swap with the explicit form.** Implement `operator=` both ways on a branch. Paste both functions. In two sentences: which one are you more confident you can write correctly under exam pressure, and why?
5. **Why doesn't a singly-linked list with a `tail_` pointer give you O(1) `pop_back`?** Answer in two sentences. (Hint: after you delete the tail, what has to point to `nullptr`, and what would it take to find it?)
6. **One-paragraph reflection.** You now have both halves of the Rule of Three implemented. State the rule in one sentence. Then: when would you reach for the **Rule of Zero** instead — and why does `Chain<T>` not qualify?

Your commit history this week should show at least three commits — Mon (doubly-linked + push_back), Wed (deep copy ctor), Fri (copy assignment + pop_front/pop_back + lab notes).

*Friend, friend!* You want to copy a chain? **Just copy the head pointer!** One line! `b.head_ = a.head_;` — done. Now you have *two* chains. Free chain! Grix gets two chains for the price of one all the time. Works perfect. Until — well. *Both go out of scope.* But by then, *Grix has left the building.*

**The Twin-Owner** — *HP: appears at end-of-scope. Damage: catastrophic, in pairs.*
Strikes when a programmer writes a class that owns memory and then accepts the compiler's default copy constructor — or, worse, writes one that copies pointers without copying what they point to. The program runs fine for a long time. Then a function returns by value, or a `vector<Chain>` resizes, or someone writes `auto b = a;`. Two objects now believe they own the same nodes. The first destructor runs and deletes them. The second destructor runs and deletes them *again*. On a good day the program crashes immediately. On a bad day it crashes a week later in production, in a place that has nothing to do with chains.

Counter by:

- **Rule of Three.** If you wrote a destructor, write the copy constructor and copy assignment *too* — or `= delete` them. Pick one. Never leave the compiler to guess.
- **Deep copy means deep.** Walk the source. Allocate every node yourself. Never write `head_ = other.head_;` in a copy constructor that owns memory. That line is the bug.
- **Copy-and-swap.** When in doubt, `Chain tmp(other); swap(*this, tmp);`. The temporary's destructor cleans up the old contents; you inherit the freshly-built copy. Three lines, exception-safe, hard to get wrong.
- **Rule of Zero.** If your class owns nothing raw — only `std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::unique_ptr` — write **none** of the special members. The compiler's defaults are correct. `Chain<T>` doesn't qualify because it owns `Node*` directly. `Bag<T>` *does* qualify, which is why Floor 3 never made you write a destructor for it.

<div class="callout check" markdown="1">
<p class="callout-title">Check for understanding</p>

Before you descend to Floor 5, you should be able to answer these without looking:

1. A doubly-linked `Node<T>` has `prev` and `next`. What is `head_->prev` on a non-empty chain? What is `tail_->next`? What are both on an empty chain?
2. `push_back` is O(1) on a doubly-linked chain *with* a `tail_` pointer. Walk through what it does in three lines. Now: why would `push_back` on a doubly-linked chain *without* a `tail_` pointer be O(n)?
3. You wrote a deep copy ctor. After `Chain<int> a; a.push_front(1); Chain<int> b = a;`, how many `Node<int>` objects exist? How many `Chain<int>` objects? Where do `a.head_` and `b.head_` point?
4. The compiler-generated copy assignment would have done `head_ = other.head_; tail_ = other.tail_; size_ = other.size_;`. Beyond the double-free, name one *other* thing this loses — what happens to the nodes `*this` *used to own* before the assignment?
5. State the Rule of Three. State the Rule of Zero. Which one does `Chain<T>` follow? Which one does `Bag<T>` follow? Why are they different?
6. `pop_back` on a doubly-linked chain with `tail_` is O(1). On a singly-linked chain with `tail_` it is O(n). What is the one step you can do in O(1) on one and not the other?

Answers are discussed in the Monday Floor 5 warmup.

*Mavren cuffs the two new rings onto your chain — one on each end — and lets it hang. Both ends touch the floor now. The vault extends still further, but the next stair leads somewhere else entirely: to a tower where the same spell walks `Bag`, `Chain`, and things you have not yet built — without caring which is which. The stair to Floor 5 — the **Eye of Scrying** — opens.*
