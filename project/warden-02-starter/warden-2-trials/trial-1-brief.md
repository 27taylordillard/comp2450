# Trial I — *The Keepers' Brief*

*Warden of the Middle Gates · Midterm 2 · 15 %*

Four short answers, one for each floor span above. **50–100 words per answer.** No code on this trial (except the one-liner in Q2); just clear thinking.

AI is welcome to *check* your answers; it is not welcome to *write your sentences*. These answers are short enough that an LLM voice is recognisable.

## 1. Floors 4 / 4½ — linked lists

> Your encounter's **event log** (every "Aric strikes Imp for 6", every "Imp retaliates for 3") is appended to `hero.eventLog`, which is a `Chain<std::string>`. Defend that against a `Bag<std::string>` (vector-backed) in terms of one operation the battle actually performs — naming the Big-O of that operation in `Chain` and in `Bag`. *Hint: think about what `Bag` has to do the moment its capacity is exceeded.*

(your answer — 50–100 words)

## 2. Floor 5 — iterators

> When the player picks the **Inspect log** menu option, your encounter calls `printLog(hero.eventLog.begin(), hero.eventLog.end(), 5, ...)` — the same function template your Floor 5 iterators brought to life. (Because `eventLog` is built with `push_front` everywhere, the *front* of the chain is the most recent entry; the forward iterator walks newest-to-oldest naturally.) Show **one line** of C++ that does the equivalent walk by hand using an explicit `Chain<std::string>::iterator` loop. Then one sentence: why is this iterator *bidirectional* (and what becomes impossible the moment you ask for random-access on it)?

```cpp
// your one-line walk
```

(one-sentence answer — bidirectional vs random-access)

## 3. Floor 6 — stacks

> Your `undo` command pops the most recent action off a `Stack<UndoAction>` and restores its snapshot. Defend the choice of stack against a queue or a deque in one sentence — referencing the *contract* of LIFO (not the implementation). Then one extra sentence: name one piece of battle state that your `undo` *intentionally does not* restore, and explain why the player won't mind.

(your answer — 50–100 words)

---

## 4. Floor 7 — queues

> Each wave's enemies sit in a `Queue<Enemy>` in arrival order. Explain — in one sentence — what *visibly* changes for the player if you swap `Queue<Enemy>` for `Stack<Enemy>`: which enemy gets attacked first, and in what order the rest are picked off.

(your answer — one or two sentences)
