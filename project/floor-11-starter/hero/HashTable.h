// COMP 2450 — Floor 11 starter
// hero/HashTable.h — the Hall of Whispers. THE WORK IS HERE (the six bodies
// in the "===== YOU WRITE =====" block near the bottom).
//
// For five floors you built pointer structures by hand: Chain, Stack, Queue,
// Tree, BST. Floor 9½ said "don't hand-roll the balanced tree — reach for
// std::set / std::map." Floor 10 reached. This floor is the LAST thing you
// build by hand — and it is the satisfying capstone of the whole build-your-own
// arc, because the thing you build is made out of a thing you already built.
//
// The Hall of Names answered in O(log n) by keeping everything in ORDER — a
// balanced tree the library walked for you. The Hall of Whispers answers in
// O(1) AVERAGE by giving up order entirely: it COMPUTES a bucket from the name
// (a hash) and goes straight there. A whisper, not a walk.
//
// =====================================================================
// What this class is — an array of the linked lists you wrote on Floor 4
// =====================================================================
// A separate-chaining hash table. The bucket array is a std::vector, and each
// slot is one of YOUR OWN Chain<Monster> linked lists (hero/Chain.h, Floor 4)
// holding every monster that hashes to that index. That is the composition
// payoff, said out loud: a hash table IS an array of the chain you already
// built. When two different names land in the same bucket — a COLLISION, which
// is not a bug but inevitable (more names than buckets) — the bucket's Chain
// simply holds both, and you scan a short list of two instead of all 15.
//
// It is keyed on the monster's NAME (a std::string), and it STORES the whole
// Monster as the value, so find() hands back a const Monster* exactly like
// Floor 10's Registry::recall. It is a concrete class (not a template) on
// purpose: the headline beat is "I wrote a hash function for a STRING key,"
// and a generic HashTable<K,V> would bury that behind a Hasher parameter.
//
// It is added IN PARALLEL to the working Bag<Monster>, BST<Monster> (Floor 9),
// and Registry (Floor 10) — nothing earlier is touched or removed. `banish`-ing
// a monster from this table does NOT touch the Bag, the BST, or the Registry;
// four independent indexes can legitimately diverge after a mutation (the
// Floor 10 page already taught the three-way version — this makes it four).
//
// =====================================================================
// What is provided vs. what you write
// =====================================================================
// PROVIDED (complete — do NOT edit): the two members, both constructors
// (including the one that walks the bestiary and insert()s each monster),
// size()/empty()/bucketCount()/loadFactor(), the read-only buckets() view the
// REPL/self-test print, and rehash() — the resize DRIVER. The driver allocates
// a fresh bucket vector and re-files every existing item into it; the ONE line
// inside it that recomputes an item's new home is yours (it is the same
// bucketIndex call — see #6).
//
// YOU WRITE (six small bodies, near the bottom):
//   Monday    — hashKey, bucketIndex, and the BASIC body of insert
//               (compute where the name lives, and put it there)
//   Wednesday — finish insert (no duplicates), find, erase
//               (one short list, not the whole table)
//   Friday    — rehashIfNeeded (+ the one re-file line in rehash above)
//               (keep the whisper a whisper as the table grows)
//
// =====================================================================
// Two traps to notice now
// =====================================================================
// (1) bucketIndex must reduce the hash code with `% bucketCount`, NEVER an
//     unchecked index. The provided constructor guarantees bucketCount() >= 1,
//     so a correct `% bucketCount` can never divide by zero.
// (2) find must compare the NAME, not just the bucket. Two names can share a
//     bucket (a collision); returning the first item in the bucket is the bug.
