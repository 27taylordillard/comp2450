## The Hold

What lies below you is what's left of the **Great Library of Algorithms** — sixteen floors that once held every craft of computation, now sealed beneath the monastery. When the **Unsorted Plague** came, it scrambled every shelf, every index, every cataloged beast — and the Library was closed. The **Order of the Sorted Tome** survives above-ground, and every year it sends one initiate down to recover what the Library lost. This year, that initiate is you.

I made the descent once. I will not say how deep. I returned with one page; it hangs in the antechamber. I will not give you answers — I will show you my stopwatch. **You have one semester. Go.**

Welcome, adventurer, to **COMP 2450 — Data Structures & Algorithms**. This semester you will descend through a dungeon of thirteen floors. Each floor teaches a new **artifact** (data structure) or **spell** (algorithm) that you will need to survive the ones below. By the end, you will have built a complete text-based dungeon crawler in C++ — not because you were told to, but because each floor's knowledge unlocked the next piece of it.

## The Floors

## The Rules of the Dungeon

- **Pre-class.** Watch the floor's video and read the assigned ZyBook sections *before* arriving.
- **In class.** MWF 50-minute sessions. We will not re-read the textbook to you. We will wield it.
- **Lab.** Hands-on exercises. Paired work encouraged.
- **The Project.** A text-based dungeon crawler you grow every single floor. One unlock per week. By Floor 12 it is a real game.
- **Exams.** Three boss fights (end of weeks 4, 9, 14) and a cumulative **Final Descent**.

## Before Floor 0

1. Install a C++ compiler (`g++` or MSVC). See the syllabus for platform notes.
2. Install a text editor or IDE. VS Code with the C/C++ extension is a good default.
3. Read [the syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/).
4. Arrive to the first class ready to discuss: *what is a data structure, and why should you care?*

*The gate creaks open. Floor 0 awaits.*
